                <h3>Think of our current crisis (Covid-19 Pandemic) situation. Recall a moment
                    where you have done something that you felt confident and your sense of self-worth
                    is high. What can you say to yourself in that situation? What have you done? Write
                    your answers on a sheet of paper.</h3>
                <p>
                    its like. come on self you can do it no matter what happens you can still do this
                    <br>
                    and sometimes on that situation im trying to discipline myself to not
                    <br>
                    use my cellphone for a whole day and not to sleep late
                    <br>
                    and instead of using cellphone i used that time 
                    <br>
                    to help my parents.
